				<h3>Description: </h3>
				<p>
    This comprehensive project I completed in my Cloud Computing 2 course at ZHAW involved the end-to-end setup, configuration, deployment, and management of distributed applications within a multi-node Kubernetes (K3S) cluster, emphasizing cloud-native patterns and operational best practices. Utilized a dedicated lab environment comprising a jumphost and three worker nodes, provisioned and managed a highly available, multi-node K3S Kubernetes cluster on dedicated virtual machines, including secure access configuration with TLS certificates.This comprehensive project involved the end-to-end setup, configuration, deployment, and management of distributed applications within a multi-node Kubernetes (K3S) cluster, emphasizing cloud-native patterns and operational best practices.
